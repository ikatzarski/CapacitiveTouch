# Capacitive Touch in Interactive Systems

There are numerous types of technologies sensing the presence of a human being. Capacitive sensing is one of them and it is one of the simplest to understand as well. In this project I describe how I use capacitive sensing and how I integrate it into a real-world object which can improve the life of its possible users.

I use several capacitive sensors in combination with light indication and integrate them into a door handle. The handle controls the traffic-light-like indicator. A user can perform different grips to choose a desirable light to indicate his or her presence or absence.

After completing the first prototype I evaluated the opinion of ten users based on their experience with the door handle. The analysis of the results, based on Grounded Theory, helped improve the prototype. Finally, the prototypeâ€™s workload was tested by interviewing ten more users using NASA TLX.

The final version of the system reached prototype two. Overall, the project is considered a success as users can effectively interact with the handle and find it easy to understand. Nevertheless, based on the results from the evaluation, this report concludes that the ease of use of the handle can be further improved. Many of the requirements, apart from the 'must have', have not been considered and this creates many gaps in the system which could be filled.
